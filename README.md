# Pynthacker
This is a suite that can be used handily in offensive network pentests by generating completely cutomised packets on the fly.
The entire repository is divided into two folders, an Attacks folder and a Structures folder. 
The Structures folder contains the classifications of various protocols into respective layers as folders. Each folder contains the structure definition of a few commonly encountered protocols of that layer. 

The Attacks folder describes the implementation of a few common attacks that use the definitions of the protocols in Structures folder.
You can freely build your own custom attack by using the strucutres, the attacks described there only exist to show that it can be done.
